# Sketches for testing LoRa 

Information on the Linksprite LoRa boards can be found here:

I was unable to get Linksprites sketch to compile (??).

## Installation

libraries required:
arduino-LoRa https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa
TinyGPSPlus https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus
SD card library
DS1307 library

## General Information

It is possiable (unlikely) that I did get a package from about 8 miles away. I've tried to duplicated the results and couldn't - so it is most likely a error in the data.

Arduino directory - contains some test sketches for the Arduino.
Data - contains some of the test collected data (not much)
Processing directory - contains the processing code.
videos - contains some videos of my testing and maybe what LoRa sounds like (?)
pictures - contains some pictures of my setup.

## Usage

At least 2 LoRa shields are needed.  One is setup as a receiver, the other as
a sender.
 I used LoRaReceiver_with_sd_logger_hmmmm and LoRaSender_with_gps for most of my early testing.  However I never got any data to log to the SD card (hence the name *_hmmmm)
The processing sketch "serial_logging" was used to monitor the serial port and create a file. (This worked mostly)
